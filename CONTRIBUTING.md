# Contribute your suggestions!

Note that just because a software merely references a pony doesn’t guarantee a place in this list, such as [My Little Password](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/my-little-password/floifiapkmdcpbnppnfjikpbmgbbdijf).

A website is considered as a ‘platform’ if it primarily hosts user-generated content.

Send a pull request with your suggestions in the appropriate category, linking to the official website (or an alternate wiki/news page if the project is defunct) and a slogan/description of the software. Thanks for contributing! /)
